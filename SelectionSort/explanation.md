## Selection Sort
Selection Sort is the simple and efficient algorithm that picks up the smallest element of unsorted part of the list and pushes it to the sorted part of the List.

## Solution

The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted.
